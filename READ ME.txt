Working on to develop a web application to increase adoption rates for animals in local shelters.
Implemented a swipe interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to browse and like animals.
Integrated with a backend server (Node.Js/Express) and a database (MongoDB) to manage animal and user data.
Utilized Restful APIs to fetch and post data, enhancing user experience with real-time updates.
